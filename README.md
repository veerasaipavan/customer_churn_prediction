Customer Churn Prediction & Segmentation
This project predicts customer churn for a bank using machine learning and provides actionable customer segmentation insights. It combines Python for data processing & modeling with Power BI for visualization, enabling data-driven retention strategies.

 Project Overview
Many businesses struggle to retain customers, especially in competitive industries like banking. This project uses historical customer data to:

Predict which customers are likely to leave (churn).

Segment customers based on key behavioral & demographic features.

Visualize results in an interactive Power BI dashboard.

 Tech Stack
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Power BI (interactive dashboard for churn insights)

Jupyter Notebook for development

 Project Workflow
1. Data Preparation
Loaded and cleaned raw customer dataset.

Handled missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions.

Performed feature engineering (e.g., tenure groups, balance ranges).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Churn distribution analysis.

Impact of demographics (age, gender, geography).

Relationship between product usage & churn.

3. Modeling
Split data into train/test sets.

Trained multiple ML models for churn prediction.

Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

4. Customer Segmentation
Applied KMeans Clustering and PCA for dimensionality reduction.

Identified distinct customer groups for targeted marketing.

5. Visualization
Designed a Power BI dashboard showing churn rates, high-risk segments, and KPIs.

 Key Insights
High churn among younger customers with fewer products.

Customers with low balances & short tenure are more likely to leave.

Certain geographic regions show higher churn probability.

 Results & Deliverables
Cleaned datasets for further use.

ML churn prediction model with best ROC-AUC score.

Customer segmentation clusters for retention strategies.

Power BI dashboard for business decision-making.

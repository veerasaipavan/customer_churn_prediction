## **Objective**
- Predict the likelihood of customer churn using machine learning models.  
- Identify key factors influencing customer attrition.  
- Segment customers for targeted retention campaigns.  
- Visualize all business KPIs through a professional Power BI dashboard.

## **Project Workflow**

### **1. Data Cleaning**
- Removed missing and duplicate records.  
- Encoded categorical variables (`Geography`, `Gender`).  
- Feature scaling for numeric columns.  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Churn rate by age group, geography, and account balance.  
- Identified churn-prone segments (e.g., low tenure, high balance inactive members).  
- Correlation heatmap to find strong predictors.  

### **3. Machine Learning**
- Train-test split for model validation.  
- Models tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.  
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.  
- Best model selected based on **ROC-AUC** and **F1 Score**.  

### **4. Customer Segmentation**
- Segmented customers into **High Risk**, **Moderate Risk**, and **Low Risk** categories based on churn probability scores.  

### **5. Dashboard (Power BI)**
- KPIs: Total Customers, Churn Rate, Active vs. Churned  
- Churn breakdown by geography, age group, and tenure  
- Feature importance visualization  
- Filters: Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure

This interactive dashboard includes:  
- **Churn Rate:** 20.4%  
- **Total Customers:** 10,000  
- **High-Risk Customers:** ~1,800  
- Churn distribution by demographics and account details  
- Top churn drivers based on feature importance

## **Key Insights**
- Customers with low tenure and high balance are more likely to churn.  
- Geography and active member status are strong churn predictors.  
- France had the highest churn rate among countries in the dataset.  
- High-risk customers can be targeted with retention offers.  

---

## **Future Improvements**
- Automate churn prediction with a scheduled pipeline.  
- Integrate real-time scoring API for customer service teams.  
- Incorporate additional behavioral data (transactions, complaints).  
- Add retention campaign performance tracking in dashboard.

Customer Churn Prediction & Segmentation with Python & Power BI
This end-to-end project identifies potential churners in a bankâ€™s customer base using machine learning, and visualizes actionable insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

Project Overview
Customer retention is a critical challenge for businesses. This project predicts customer churn and segments users for targeted retention strategies using Python for modeling and Power BI for visualization.

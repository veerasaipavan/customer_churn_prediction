Customer Churn Prediction & Segmentation with Python & Power BI
This end-to-end project identifies potential churners in a bank’s customer base using machine learning, and visualizes actionable insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
Project Overview
Many businesses struggle to retain customers. This project focuses on predicting customer churn and segmenting users for targeted retention strategies using both Python and Power BI.
Cleaned and preprocessed customer data
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Built machine learning models to predict churn
Handled class imbalance using SMOTE
Applied KMeans clustering for customer segmentation
Reduced dimensions using PCA for cluster visualization
Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI
Files Included
customer_churn_prediction_with_segmentation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with full pipeline (EDA ➝ ML ➝ Clustering)
Bank Customer Churn Prediction.csv: Dataset used for training and analysis
customer churn dashboard.pbix: Final interactive Power BI dashboard
Technologies Used
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Churn distribution
Age vs Churn rate
Geography and gender insights
Tenure vs Balance correlation
Machine Learning Models
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
### Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy
ROC-AUC
Classification Report
Customer Segmentation
### Used KMeans clustering to group customers into meaningful segments:
High-risk churners
Loyal customers
Low engagement customers
Applied PCA for 2D visualization of clusters.
Power BI Dashboard Highlights
KPIs: Total Customers, Churn Rate, Retention %
Filters: Gender, Geography, Tenure, Age Range
Visuals: Clustered column charts, line charts, churn by age & tenure
Goal: Help stakeholders monitor churn risk and segment behavior
How to Use
Open the Jupyter notebook and run each cell to reproduce the analysis
Load the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop to explore the dashboard
Replace the dataset with your own CSV for reuse
Key Results
Achieved 87% accuracy with Random Forest
Applied SMOTE to improve model performance
Built clear visual stories using Power BI
Provided segmentation-based recommendations for marketing
